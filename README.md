# fim_client-minecraft_education-hack
A cmd-python-base minecraft Education edition hack client. Still under hard development and there is no versions out right now.
Basicly a external 1.14 client because mced is on 1.14.??.

Planned features:
 give command,
 setcontainer command,
 tp command,
 fly (maybe on V2/V3),
 autoclicker,
 autobridger,
 hotkeys (maybe V1/V2),
 lagger.


Currently testing packet_send and reading 1.14 packet protocol.
