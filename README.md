# fim_client-minecraft_education-hack
A cmd-python-base minecraft Education edition hack client. Still under hard development and there is no versions out right now.
Basicly a external 1.14 client because mced is on 1.14.??.

Planned features:
 give command,
 setcontainer command,
 effect command,
 tp command,
 fly (maybe on V2/V3),
 autoclicker,
 autobridger,
 hotkeys (maybe V1/V2).
 
 For give/setcontainer/effect commands use id's from here: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bedrock_Edition_data_values .


Currently working on Fim client V1 and reading 1.14 packet protocol.
V1 outcoming date: july 2021?
